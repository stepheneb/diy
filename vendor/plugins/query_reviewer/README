QueryReviewer
=============

QueryReviewer is an advanced SQL query analyzer.  It accomplishes the following goals:

 * View all EXPLAIN output for all SELECT queries to generate a page
 * Rate a page's SQL usage into one of three categories: OK, WARNING, CRITICAL
 * Attach meaningful warnings to individual queries
 * Display interactive summary on page

All you have to do is install it.  You can optionally run:
  rake query_reviewer:setup

Which will create config/query_reviewer.yml.  This file provides a few useful settings:
 * enabled: whether any output or query analysis is performed.  Set this FALSE in production!
 * inject_view: controls whether the output automatically is injected before the </body> in HTML output.
 * warn_severity: the severity of problem that merits "WARNING" status
 * critical_severity: the severity of problem that merits "CRITICAL" status
 * warn_query_count: the number of queries in a single request that merits "WARNING" status
 * critical_query_count: the number of queries in a single request that merits "CRITICAL" status
 
Example
=======

If you disable the inject_view option, you'll need to manually put the analyzer's output into your view:

<%= query_review_output %>
