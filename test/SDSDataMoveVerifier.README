This is a simple java application to verify that the bundles moved when running 'rake diy:migrate_sds_data' was correctly moved to the new SDS. 

To compile it:
  1) Run 'javac SDSDataMoveVerifier.java'

To use it:
 1) First run the rake task 'rake diy:migrate_sds_data'. The rake task generates the file tmp/bundle_transfer.csv, which is a comma separated list of old-bundle-url/new-bundle-url pairs.
 2) Run the program with the file location as the argument (e.g. java SDSDataMoveVerifier /Users/aunger/diy/tmp/bundle_transfer.csv).
    Status will be printed on stdout, and any mismatched bundles will be noted via stderr.
